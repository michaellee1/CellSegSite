<p>This is a tutorial on how to set up and run CellSeg. This tutorial will cover: </p>

<ul>
	<li> How to open the CellSeg program in terminal/Anaconda prompt </li>
	<li> How to organize your images before segmentation </li>
	<li> How to change parameters for segmentation in the cvconfig.py file </li>
	<li> Details of parameters for CellSeg </li>
	<li> How to run CellSeg to segment your data </li>
</ul>

<p>This tutorial assumes you have completed the CellSeg installation tutorial <a href="https://https://michaellee1.github.io/CellVisionSite/install.html">here</a>. This tutorial assumes no programming experience with Python or terminal. </p>



<h2 id="CellSeg_open_jupyter">Part 1: Opening the CellSeg program in Jupyter Notebook </h2>

<p>First, we’re going to open the CellSeg program. Jupyter Notebook is a software that runs from an internet browser and provides a user-friendly way to view, edit, and run Python programs. First, in Anaconda prompt (Windows) or terminal (MacOS or Linux), navigate to the folder containing the CellSeg software as described in part 2 of the installation tutorial <a href="https://https://michaellee1.github.io/CellVisionSite/install.html">here</a>, then activate your conda environment you had created for CellSeg in part 3 of the installation tutorial <a href="https://https://michaellee1.github.io/CellVisionSite/install.html">here</a> by typing: </p>

<p><code> conda activate env_name</code></p>

<p>where you replace <code> env_name </code> with the name of your conda environment for CellSeg. To open CellSeg in Jupyter Notebook, next type: </p>

<p><code>jupyter notebook</code> and hit enter. </p>


<p>Jupyter notebook should open automatically in your default browser. If it doesn’t open, copy the first URL underneath the line “Or copy and paste one of these URLs:” and paste it into your browser of choice. When Jupyter notebook opens in your browser, you should see this:</p>
