<p>CellVision has a one time package install using <code>conda</code>, a package manager bundled into miniconda.  Package install without program install is by design - see section for advanced users below.</p>
<p>Download CellVision for Linux here, and extract into any directory of your choosing.  This tutorial does assume a very basic grasp of the terminal.</p>
<h3 id="miniconda">Miniconda</h3>
<ul>
<li>Install miniconda if you don’t already have it, using the .sh file <a href="https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Windows-x86_64.exe">here</a>.</li>
<li>Make sure you can run <code>conda</code> from the command line without any issues.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="installing-cellvision-environment">Installing CellVision Environment</h3>
<ul>
<li>Open a terminal of choice and navigate to the directory where you extracted CellVision.</li>
<li>Run the following commands in the terminal, without the <em>$</em> in front</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>$ conda create -y --name cellVision python==3.7
$ conda install -f -y -q --name cellVision -c conda-forge --file requirements.txt
</code></pre>
<p>Note that the install may take a while!</p>
<h1 id="running-cellvision-linux">Running CellVision (Linux)</h1>
<h3 id="config-file">Config File</h3>
<p>CellVision depends on a <code>cvconfig.py</code> file located in the directory where you downloaded CellVision.  You will change the parameters in this configuration file to tell CellVision where to segment your images.</p>
<h4 id="important-configuration-settings">Important configuration settings</h4>
<p>DIRECTORY_PATH - directory that contains your .tif bestFocus images (usually the bestFocus folder)<br>
CHANNEL_PATH - path to your channels file (usually called channelNames.txt)<br>
NUCLEAR_CHANNEL_NAME - name of nuclear stain (corresponding to channelNames.txt). Case sensitive.<br>
OUTPUT_METHOD - (imagej_text_file, statistics, visual_image_output, visual_overlay_output, all)<br>
BOOST - multiplier with which to boost the pixels of the nuclear stain before inference</p>
<p>Other settings are documented within the configuration file itself.</p>
<h4 id="modifying-the-configuration-file">Modifying the configuration file</h4>
<p>You can modify this file in any text editor of your choice.  We will use VSCode for this tutorial.<br>
(ADD IMAGE)<br>
Change the parameters above to match the desired image directory, segmentation channel, boost, and output method desired.<br>
(ADD IMAGE)</p>
<h3 id="running-cellvision">Running CellVision</h3>
<p>Now that the config file has been set, we can easily run CellVision.<br>
From the CellVision folder, run the following, without the <em>$</em> in front</p>
<pre><code>$ conda activate cellVision
$ python main.py
</code></pre>
<p>CellVision should run and segment all images within the director you specified!</p>
<h2 id="advanced-users">Advanced Users</h2>
<p>By design, the actual application is self contained, so the directory can be moved and run from anywhere on your machine!  This means that all the code is immediately modifiable for advanced users.</p>
<h4 id="code-outline">Code Outline</h4>
<p><code>main.py</code> - runs</p>
